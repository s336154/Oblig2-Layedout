    <p>I have used several elements and materials that I have learned so far to create this project. <br>
     The most challenging part within this project is the layout and positioning. I am really proud of <br>
      myself for making this mobile screen responsive design. I was always exposed to resources that was mainly<br>
     builded for desktop screens or medium screens such as tablets. <br>
      I have used &lt;img&gt; tag to include the pictures that I have chosen for this project.<br>
      This reason why I chose this specific tag is that this was the most suited for grid structured container.<br>
      The best part of this all is when everything finally work out &amp; you are able to implement your idea..<br>
      In order to build this website I have gone through all the learning materials <br>
      that were available on the university platform. The resources included several <br>
      links into tutorial websites that would be beneficial for designing.<br>
      It took huge amount of time, effort &amp; patience to create this project but luckily we are two members this time. <br>
     Going back to the challenges that I had while creating this project, I would say that positioning can be really complicated.<br>
      This is especially when you do not design lots of pages yet..<br>
      I think the grid structures are the most beneficial solution for website design..<br>
      I have always thought that designing is very creative and fun but time challenging as well.<br>
      I look forward to work with such website designing projects in the future . . <br>

      <div class="about">  <h2> Desktop Layout </h2> </div>

      <div class="p2">
      <p>There were a few challenges while trying to write the code for the wireframes. . </br>
          The main challenge was trying to know exactly which display element to use to have the images &amp; </br>
          the text appear in the same container. </br>
          However, after a little bit of trial and error, this was fixed. For the images and images description, </br>
          "figure","img" and "figcaption" were used as this groups the elements together and makes it easier when styling. </br>
          The main challenges while implementing the page in regards to its responsive nature </br>
          were knowing what width and height to use for the desktop layout and mobile layout </br>
          ( Maybe partner knows more, since she did the mobile page)
